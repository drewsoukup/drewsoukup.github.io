    "section": "",
    "text": "We’ve seen players who are on another level in the NBA, but none other impact the game offensively in every facet the way Nikola Jokic does. Night after night he’s stuffing stat sheets averaging 21.8 points, 10.9 rebounds and 7.2 assists across his decade-long career. A DECADE of almost a triple-double every night on average. There’s a reason why he’s won 3 NBA MVP awards.\nBut it’s not just individual accolades Jokic has achieved, he’s lead the charge of historically good team basketball for the Denver Nuggets. Jokic has lead them to six consecutive playoff appearances winning a championship as well in 2023. His unselfishness and willingness to make the right play to win has lead the Nuggets offense to be in a stratosphere of their own. Even when comparing to the last 5 other champions in the NBA, over those 5 years the Nuggets blow them out of the water offensively.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\ncurrent_teamlogs &lt;- load_nba_team_box(seasons = 2020:2025) |&gt; \n  filter(team_display_name != \"Team Giannis\") |&gt; \n  filter(team_display_name != \"Team LeBron\") |&gt;\n  filter(team_display_name != \"Western Conf All-Stars\") |&gt;\n  filter(team_display_name != \"Eastern Conf All-Stars\") |&gt;\n  filter(team_display_name != \"USA\") |&gt;\n  filter(team_display_name != \"World\") |&gt; \n  filter(team_display_name != \"Team Shaq\") |&gt; \n  filter(team_display_name != \"Team Kenny\") |&gt; \n  filter(team_display_name != \"Team Chuck\") |&gt; \n  filter(team_display_name != \"Team Durant\") |&gt; \n  filter(team_display_name != \"Team Candace\")\n\ncurrent_avgs &lt;- current_teamlogs |&gt;\n  group_by(team_display_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    games = n(),\n    avg_pts = mean(team_score,),\n    avg_fg_pct = mean(field_goal_pct,),\n    avg_ast = mean(assists,),\n    avg_reb = mean(total_rebounds,),\n    avg_turnovers = mean(team_turnovers,), \n    avg_threepct = mean(three_point_field_goal_pct),\n    wins = sum(team_winner)\n    )\n\nnuggets &lt;- current_avgs |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"Denver Nuggets\")\nthunder &lt;- current_avgs |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"Oklahoma City Thunder\")\nwarriors &lt;- current_avgs |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"Golden State Warriors\") \nbucks &lt;- current_avgs |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"Milwaukee Bucks\")\nlakers &lt;- current_avgs |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"Los Angeles Lakers\")\nceltics &lt;- current_avgs |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"Boston Celtics\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=current_avgs, \n    aes(x=avg_ast, y=avg_fg_pct, size=wins), \n    color=\"grey\", alpha=.3) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=nuggets, \n    aes(x=avg_ast, y=avg_fg_pct, size=wins), \n    color=\"darkblue\", alpha=.5) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=thunder, \n    aes(x=avg_ast, y=avg_fg_pct, size=wins), \n    color=\"orange\", alpha=.5) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=celtics, \n    aes(x=avg_ast, y=avg_fg_pct, size=wins), \n    color=\"green\", alpha=.5) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=lakers, \n    aes(x=avg_ast, y=avg_fg_pct, size=wins), \n    color=\"purple\", alpha=.5) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=bucks, \n    aes(x=avg_ast, y=avg_fg_pct, size=wins), \n    color=\"darkgreen\", alpha=.5) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=warriors, \n    aes(x=avg_ast, y=avg_fg_pct, size=wins), \n    color=\"blue\", alpha=.5) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 25.22693) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 46.76517) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=nuggets, \n    aes(x=avg_ast, y=avg_fg_pct, label=team_display_name), nudge_x = -0.2\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=thunder, \n    aes(x=avg_ast, y=avg_fg_pct, label=team_display_name)\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=warriors, \n    aes(x=avg_ast, y=avg_fg_pct, label=team_display_name)\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=bucks, \n    aes(x=avg_ast, y=avg_fg_pct, label=team_display_name), nudge_y = -0.2\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=celtics, \n    aes(x=avg_ast, y=avg_fg_pct, label=team_display_name), nudge_x = -0.5\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=lakers, \n    aes(x=avg_ast, y=avg_fg_pct, label=team_display_name), nudge_y = .2\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Average Assists Per Game\", \n    y=\"Average Field Goal Percentage\", \n    title=\"Jokic makes the Nuggets unstoppable\", \n    subtitle=\"The Denver Nuggets offense is one of the best the last 5 years which lead to lots of wins\", \n    caption=\"Source: HoopR | By Drew Soukup\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our lifetime (2003 – Present) we haven’t seen someone who impacts an offense quite like Jokic over his prime. Comparing 2020-2025 Jokic to some of the greats of the 21st century shows how dominant and impactful he is. Even amongst a list of 2014-2018 Steph Curry, 2003-2007 Kobe Bryant, 2009-2013 Lebron James, 2018-2022 Giannis Antetokounmpo, 2019-2023 Joel Embiid, 2016-2020 James Harden and 2013-2017 Kevin Durant, Nikola Jokic stands out as one of the most impactful half-decades offensively we’ve seen. Jokic’s impact for the Nuggets when on the floor vs off is wider than any of these primes we’ve seen to this day.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\non_off &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC-350/PROJECT 1/splits final v3.csv\")\n\non_off_avgs &lt;- on_off |&gt;\n  group_by(Player, Split) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    avg_ORT = mean(Team_ORtg)\n  )\n\nsplits &lt;- on_off_avgs |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = Split,\n    values_from = avg_ORT)\n\nsplits |&gt; \nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=splits, \n    aes(y=Player, x=Off_Court, xend=On_Court),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"red\",\n    colour_xend = \"darkgreen\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Off Court vs On Court Offensive Rating\", \n    y=\"\", \n    title=\"Jokic's presence on court is unlike any other player's prime\", \n    subtitle=\"Denver's offensive rating is much better when Nikola Jokic is on the court\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Drew Soukup\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 13, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Triple-Double himself can’t help but put himself on all-time lists year after year. In season PRA (Points + Rebounds + Assists) since 2003, he’s landed in the top 10 three times. The only other players to make it twice are James Harden and Kobe Bryant who both averaged over 30 points in their respective seasons.
